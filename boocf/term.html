    <p>Last Updated: March 28, 2015</p>
    <p>Welcome to Munchery, located at <a href="https://www.munchery.com">munchery.com</a> (our “<strong>Site</strong>”)! Please read these Terms of Use (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) carefully because they govern your use of our Site, our mobile application (our “<strong>App</strong>”), and the other services we provide via our Site and App (our Site, our App, and our other services will be referred to as the “<strong>Services</strong>”).</p>
    <h4>Agreement to Terms</h4>
    <p>By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.</p>
    <h4>Changes to Terms or Services</h4>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site, in our App, or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site or in our App or have communicated them to you, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you can’t use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p>
    <h4>Who May Use the Services</h4>
    <p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
    <p>You may use the Services only if you are at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract with Munchery and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.  If you’re under 18 years old, you may not use any of our Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Registration and Your Information</strong></p>
    <p>If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to create an account (“<strong>Account</strong>”). You can do this on our Site, in our App, or through your account with certain third-party social networking services, such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an “<strong>SNS Account</strong>”). If you choose the SNS Account option, we’ll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information, such as your name, email address, and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.</p>
    <p>It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your Account, so you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete, and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and that you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them, so please keep your password secret and secure.</p>
    <p>We want to keep all our users safe and happy, so we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to disable, suspend, cancel, or delete any Account for any reason, or to refuse any user access to any of our Services, if we think doing so will help keep things safe and enjoyable for everybody.</p>
    <h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>Please refer to our <a href="https://munchery.com/about/privacy-and-terms-of-service/"> Privacy Policy</a> for information on how we collect, use, and disclose your information.</p>
    <h4>The Services</h4>
    <p>We provide a platform through which users can buy quality meals and food items (the “<strong>Meals</strong>”) at fixed prices. We want you to love not just the Meals you find on our Site and in our App but also the whole experience you get from using our Services. We’re confident that you’ll love Munchery, but please understand that you use our Services at your own risk. You agree to hold us, as well as our officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint venturers, and employees (jointly and severally, our “<strong>Affiliates</strong>”) not liable, to the full extent permissible under all applicable law, for any harm, loss, or damage that may come to you or to anyone else as a consequence of your use of our Services.</p>
    <p>When you buy a Meal through any of our Services (such purchase, a “<strong>Transaction</strong>”), we may ask you to supply additional information relevant to your Transaction, including, without limitation, your credit-card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your address(es) for billing and delivery (such information, “<strong>Payment Information</strong>”). You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information, whether you provide it in the course of a Transaction or in connection with your Account. When you initiate a Transaction, you authorize us to provide your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete your Transaction; you may need to provide additional information to verify your identity before completing your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).</p>
    <p>All sales are final.  But if something unexpected happens in the course of fulfilling your order, we reserve the right to cancel your order for any reason; if we cancel your order, we’ll refund any payment you may already have remitted to us.</p>
    <p>We make a conscientious effort to describe and display every Meal accurately on our Site and in our App. Because all our Meals are handcrafted by excellent chefs, however, occasionally a Meal you receive won’t look or taste exactly as it was described or depicted to you. You understand that this is normal, and you agree to accept such a Meal, regardless of reasonable variation from its description or depiction. We can’t and don’t guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any description or depiction of any Meal. We reserve the right to change or update any such description or depiction and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without giving you notice.</p>
    <p>We can’t guarantee that every Meal will arrive exactly within the timeframe we give you when you initiate a Transaction. If a Meal arrives early or late, you agree that you will still accept the Meal and release us from all liability for any loss, damage, or inconvenience that you encounter as a result of early or late delivery.</p>
    <p>If you have a complaint or dispute concerning a Meal you’ve purchased through our Services, please contact us, and we’ll try to fix the problem in the manner we deem appropriate, in our discretion.</p>

    <p>We welcome feedback, comments, and suggestions for improvements to our Services (“<strong>Feedback</strong>”). You can submit Feedback by emailing us at support@munchery.com.

THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.</p>
    <p>THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.</p>
    <h4>Dispute Resolution</h4>
    <p><strong>Governing Law</strong></p>
    <p>These Terms and any action related to them will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
    <p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>
    <p>You and we agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “<strong>IP Protection Action</strong>”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and we otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
    <p><strong>Arbitration Rules</strong></p>
    <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
    <p><strong>Arbitration Process</strong></p>
    <p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</a> and a separate form for California residents at <a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822</a>.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
    <p><strong>Arbitration Location and Procedure</strong></p>
    <p>Unless you and we otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and we submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
    <p><strong>Arbitrator’s Decision</strong></p>
    <p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.</p>
    <p><strong>Fees</strong></p>
    <p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
    <p><strong>Changes</strong></p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the section, above, concerning changes to these Terms or to the Services, if we change this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to www.Munchery.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and we in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).</p>
    <h4>General Terms</h4>
    <p>These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and us regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and us regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitrator finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
    <p>Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) by us via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p>
    <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of us. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
